# Historian
This library captures the state of an object by printing it onto a file.  

## The Core
The core does the actual recording stuff. The recorded data will be written onto an XML file,
or simply onto a text file (with indentations to indicate children).

## The Parser
~~This thing is a layer that sits on top of the core. All it does is present the data the core has recorded
in some easy to read form for the user.~~  
Simply use a third party XML tree viewer app.
